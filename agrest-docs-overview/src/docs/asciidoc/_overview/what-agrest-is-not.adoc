== What Agrest is Not

Agrest is not an automated engine to take your DB online with a single command.
You still have to write code for JAX-RS endpoints (however simple and trivial that code might end up being).
Having this code around allows you to customize processing, implement security around endpoints, hide certain methods, etc.
This is a defensive approach that goes a long way to avoid unintended consequences when opening up your data on the web.

Having said that, such an engine can be written on top of Agrest with relative ease.
