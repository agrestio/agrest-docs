= Getting Started

Through this tutorial we will build a simple Bookstore REST application in Agrest with a real database. Agrest can work
with various REST API stacks, and different backends. The tutorial will be done with the following components:

* SpringBoot / JAX-RS 2 (via `spring-boot-starter-jersey`)
* Derby database
* Apache Cayenne ORM backend

To build the project, we'll be using Maven and Java 17. But keep in mind that Agrest would work fine with Gradle and
supports Java versions 11 and higher. The full tutorial code is available
