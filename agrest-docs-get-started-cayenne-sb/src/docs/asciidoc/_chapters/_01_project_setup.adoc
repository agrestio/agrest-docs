== Project Setup

Letâ€™s start with a new Java Maven project created in your favorite IDE. Once you have a `pom.xml` file, add a
`<dependencyManagement/>` section with "BOM" ("Bill of Materials") declarations for Spring Boot and Agrest:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../pom.xml[tag=bom]
----
This will allow the following `<dependencies/>` section to include Agrest, Spring and other modules and not
worry about their individual versions. Now let's set up the `<dependencies/>` section:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../pom.xml[tag=agrest-dependencies]
----
The first two dependencies are Agrest-related, others are SpringBoot and Derby.
