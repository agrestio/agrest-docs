== Setting up the Project

Letâ€™s start with a new Java Maven project created in your favorite IDE. Once you have a POM file, let's add a
`<dependencyManagement/>` section with Agrest "BOM" ("Bill of Materials"):

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../pom.xml[tag=bom]
----
This will allow the `<dependencies/>` section that follows to include various Agrest modules and not
worry about their individual versions. Now let's set up the `<dependencies/>` section:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../pom.xml[tag=agrest-dependencies]
----
The first two dependencies are Agrest-related, others are SpringBoot and Derby.
