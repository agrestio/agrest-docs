== OpenAPI Documentation

It is a good practice to document your APIs for the benefit of consumers. The most popular format for REST API
documentation is https://swagger.io/specification/[OpenAPI 3]. Agrest integrates with the Swagger library to expose
its endpoints as OpenAPI model. Let's include it in our tutorial.

Start by adding `agrest-jaxrs2-openapi` dependency to the `pom.xml`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../pom.xml[tag=openapi-dependencies]
----

Now add OpenAPI bootstrap code to `AgrestApp`:


[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../main/java/io/agrest/tutorial/sb/AgrestApp.java[tag=openapi-bootstrap]
----
<1> Adding this line to `AgRuntime` builder would indicate to Swagger that the API model for both Book and Author
entities should be taken from Agrest instead of using reflection on the Java classes.
<2> Add Swagger endpoint to the app.

Now you can restart the application and go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/openapi.json . You will see the app model in
JSON format, including all the Agrest query parameters.

The next step is to add a Swagger UI browser for visual exploration of the documentation. We will use a Swagger
intergation library from https://springdoc.org/ . Let's add it as a dependency:
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../pom.xml[tag=swagger-dependencies]
----
And now create `src/main/resources/application.properties` file and add the following configuration entry in it:
[source,indent=0]
----
include::../../../main/resources/application.properties[]
----
Restart the application and go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/swagger-ui.html . You should see Swagger UI for your model:

NOTE: You can use Swagger annotations (such as `@OpenAPIDefinition`, `@Operation`, etc.) on `BookApi` and `AuthorApi`
to provide extra information about the endpoints.
