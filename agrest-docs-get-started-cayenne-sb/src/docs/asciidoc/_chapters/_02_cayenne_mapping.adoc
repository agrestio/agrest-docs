== Book Store in Agrest

Through this tutorial we will build a simple Bookstore REST application with a real database.

Let’s start with a new Java Maven project created in your favorite IDE. Your `pom.xml`, in addition
to the required project tags, will need to declare a BOM ("Bill of Material") import for Agrest in the
`<dependencyManagement/>` section:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../pom.xml[tag=bom]
----
This will allow the `<dependencies/>` section that follows to include various Agrest modules and not
worry about their individual versions. So let’s create `<dependencies>..</dependencies>` tags and
import a few modules:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../pom.xml[tag=agrest-dependencies]
----

In addition to Agrest, let's add the dependencies on Jersey and Derby:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../pom.xml[tag=other-dependencies]
----
