= Getting Started

This tutorial walks you through creation of a simple Agrest application.
With Agrest, there are some choices to be made for the REST engine and
(to an extent) backends. For the tutorial we will use the following:

* JAX-RS 3 (Jakarta)
* Jersey 3 REST framework
* Java HTTP Server (can be replaced with SpringBoot, Jetty, etc.)
* Apache Cayenne ORM backend

To build the project we'll be using Maven (can be done in Gradle too of course) and
Java 17 (should also work on Java 11).
