= Getting Started

This tutorial walks you through creation of a simple Agrest application. Agrest can work with various REST API stacks,
and different backends. This tutorial will be done with the following components:

* SpringBoot / JAX-RS 2 (via `spring-boot-starter-jersey`)
* Derby database with Apache Cayenne ORM backend

To build the project we'll be using Maven and Java 17. Here you also have some choices - Agrest would work fine with
Gradle and supports Java versions 11 and higher.
