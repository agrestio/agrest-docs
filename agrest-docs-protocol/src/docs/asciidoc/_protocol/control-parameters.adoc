== Control Parameters

Control parameters, usually passed as URL keys, apply to the Collection Document and let
the server to provide a single generic endpoint per entity, while still allowing the client
to shape up the response Collection to its liking. These parameters are normally used with
GET, however POST/PUT can also return a Collection Document, so many of the parameters are
also applicable when modifying the data.
