== Overview

Agrest Protocol is a simple HTTP/JSON-based message protocol. It operates on an object
model implicitly shared between a client and a server. It defines the format of JSON
documents exchanged between client and server, and a set of control parameters that let the
client control representation of the model returned from the server. E.g. the client may
request a range of objects, sorted in a specific order, matching a criteria, with each
object including a subset of attributes and related entities. This gives the client exactly
what it needs, thus simplifying the code, minimizing the number of trips to the server, and
optimizing the size of the response.

Content type of `application/json` is used in both requests and responses where applicable.
Values of some control parameters below are also represented as JSON.

All examples below use a data model for an imaginary CMS made of 2 entities: Domain
and Article, with a 1-to-N relationship between them:
