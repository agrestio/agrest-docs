=== Filtering Collection with `exp`

NOTE: "exp" key was first introduced in Agrest 4.1. Previously it was called "cayenneExp".
Both are synonymous. "cayenneExp" is still supported, though should be considered deprecated.

A condition expression used to filter the response objects. Expression follow syntax of the
https://cayenne.apache.org/docs/4.0/cayenne-guide/expressions.html[Apache Cayenne expressions].
An implicit "root" for the property paths is the request entity, (unless "exp" is used within
an "include" JSON, in which case the root is that related entity).

Example 1: Filtering on a single property.

`exp=vhost='agrest.io'`


Example 2: Filtering using outer join (the "+" sign is notation for "outer").

`exp=articles+ = null`


Example 3: Filtering with parameters using positional bindings.

`exp=["articles.body like $b","%Agrest%"]`


Example 4: Filtering with parameters using named bindings.

`exp={ "exp" : "articles.body like $b", "params":{"b":"%Agrest%"}}`
