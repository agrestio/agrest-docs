== Dates and Times

JSON doesn't have data types for either date or time. Both are represented as strings.
Server and client must ensure that date/time strings are in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601 format]. E.g.:

[source]
----
2015-04-19T11:08:53Z
2015-04-10T11:08
2015-04-19

Developers should not assume that the server is in the same time zone as the browser.
All timezone-aware expressions should contain time zone offset or "Z" suffix (for "Zulu" time).
