=== Update Document

Update Document is sent in a _request_ body from the client to the server to modify an entity collection.
It is a Collection document stripped down to its "data" section. There are two flavors -
a single object and an array of objects:

[source,json]
----
{ "id" : 5, "name": "X" }
----


[source,json]
----
[
   { "id" : 5, "name": "X" },
   { "id" : 8, "name": "Y" }
]
