=== Simple Document

This document is used in _responses_ that contain no data, just a boolean status and a
message. On success, it might look like this:

[source,json]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
   "success" : true,
   "message" : "all is good"
}
----


On failure, it might look like this:

[source,json]
----
HTTP/1.1 500 Server error
Content-Type: application/json

{
   "success" : false,
   "message" : "Database connection failure"
}
----
