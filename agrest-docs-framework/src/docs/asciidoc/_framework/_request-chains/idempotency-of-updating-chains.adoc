=== Idempotency of Updating Chains

It is easy to distinguish updating chains that are idempotent from those that are not
(chain factory method starts with "idempotent" for the former). Both work the same way, except
that "idempotent" ones perform an extra check on the input to ensure that it is repeatable,
i.e. it will be safe to run it multiple times with the same effect as running it once. At the
minimum this means that all the "new" objects have their ids set in the request. This is where
  `ByKeyObjectMapperFactory` discussed above comes in handy. Pretty much all
idempotent chains need to use `ByKeyObjectMapperFactory` or an equivalent mapper to
match by some unique property of the entity, that is known to the client at the object
creation time.
