=== Read a Single Entity with `GET`

A common request is to locate a single instance of an entity by ID. Here is how
this can be done with Agrest:

[source, Java]
----
import io.agrest.DataResponse;
import io.agrest.Ag;

...

@GET
@Path("{id}")
public DataResponse<Domain> getOne(@PathParam("id") int id, @Context UriInfo uriInfo) {
    return Ag.select(Domain.class, config).byId(id).uri(uriInfo).getOne();
}
----

Here we are binding "id" as a URL path parameter, but also notice that Agrest doesn't
mandate any specific place in the URL for ID. This is a decision made by the developer.
Calling this endpoint, we'll get an expected result:

`curl -i -X GET 'http://example.org/myapp/domain/1'`

[source, JSON]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "data" : [
        { "id" : 1, "name" : "My Site #1", "vhost" : "mysite1.example.org" }
    ],
    "total" : 1
}
----

Even though we expect at most one object to be returned, the response is the same Collection
Document as we've seen before.
