=== stage

Just add `stage` method to the chain and put two parameters:

 * Name of stage after which your custom processing apply.
 * Lambda expression that implements the processing.

The implementation can use provided `SelectContext` for inspecting and modifying.
Please, pay attention that the context may have different state for different stages.

@Context
private Configuration config;

@GET
@Path("{id}")
public DataResponse<Domain> getOne(@PathParam("id") int id, @Context UriInfo uriInfo) {
    return Ag.select(Domain.class, config)
             .byId(id)
             .uri(uriInfo)
             .stage(SelectStage.PARSE_REQUEST, (SelectContext<Domain> c) -> {
                // TODO: Add a customization with regards of the parse request stage
             })
             .getOne();
}

Agrest supports the following stage types:

.6+|SelectStage |START
                |PARSE_REQUEST
                |CREATE_ENTITY
                |APPLY_SERVER_PARAMS
                |ASSEMBLE_QUERY
                |FETCH_DATA
.6+|UpdateStage |START
                |PARSE_REQUEST
                |CREATE_ENTITY
                |APPLY_SERVER_PARAMS
                |UPDATE_DATA_STORE
                |FILL_RESPONSE
.2+|DeleteStage |START
                |DELETE_IN_DATA_STORE
|===

Apart of the `stage` method Agrest provides additional two `terminalStage` and `routingStage` methods.
These two could be customised in the same way.

Please, pay attention that these stage operations are composable. For each stage all custom processors will be invoked in the order they were registered.
