=== terminalStage

Registers a consumer to be executed after the specified standard execution stage.
The rest of the standard pipeline following the named stage will be skipped.
This is useful for quick assembly of custom back-ends that reuse the initial stages of Agrest processing,
but query the data store on their own. The consumer can inspect and modify provided context `SelectContext` or `UpdateContext`.
