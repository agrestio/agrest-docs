== Dependencies

Agrest provides a number of modules that are added as dependencies to your app. To give a Maven example, the first
thing you would usually import is the BOM (a so-called "bill of materials") that will define the version of all the
other modules.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../pom.xml[tag=bom]
----

Now you can include individual Agrest libraries in your projects without thinking about their version.
