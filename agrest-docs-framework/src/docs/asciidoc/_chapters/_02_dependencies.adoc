== Dependencies

Before we can start writing Agrest apps, we need to include the modules that we need as dependencies. While the
framework has many modules, the first step is usually to import the common BOM (a so-called "bill of
materials") that will define the version of all the other modules. It is placed in the `<dependencyManagement/>`
section of the `pom.xml`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../pom.xml[tag=bom]
----
With this out of the way, we will show the use of individual Agrest modules in your projects without having to worry
about their version.

NOTE: While all the build examples are Maven-based, Agrest apps most certainly can be assembled with  Gradle
or any other Java build tool you might prefer.
