== Dependencies

Before we can start writing Agrest apps, we need to include the relevant modules as dependencies. The first
step is usually to import the common BOM (a so-called "bill of materials"), that will define the version of all
the other modules. It is placed in the `<dependencyManagement/>` section of the `pom.xml`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../pom.xml[tag=bom]
----
With this out of the way, the rest of the document will show the use of individual Agrest dependencies without having
to worry about their version.

NOTE: While all the build examples are Maven-based, Agrest apps most certainly can be assembled with  Gradle
or any other Java build tool you might prefer.
